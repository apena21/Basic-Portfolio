      <!-- Paragraph with embedded link -->
      <p>I'm a native New Englander adjusting to Southern living in North Carolina. Though originally from the Boston area, I moved here after spending more than a 
          decade in New York City. Boston Red Sox or Yankees?  No comment. But I will say that that slower pace of Chapel Hill has its perks and the 
          food around here is pretty good!</p>
          <p>
        I'm pretty  busy don't always get to enjoy my hobbies, but when I do have free time I love to exercise,
        especially swimming and spinning, reading, and learning new things.  These days I'm focusing on learning how to code and how to speak German. I also  
       love to eat, especially pizza, beer, and vegan chocolate cheesecake.  I am not vegan or even vegetarian, but this particular vegan chocolate cheesecake 
       recipe is awesome!</a></p>
